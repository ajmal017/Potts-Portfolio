    "# Phone Number Dialing and Unique Graph Paths\n",

    "I was asked this question on a job application recently. It was a question that I thoroughly enjoyed answering! My solution to this question was primarily influenced by my current work regarding touring times of incomplete graphs. It just happens that if you structure the questiong in terms of an incomplete graph, a solution can be found using an adjacency matrix, which I have been\n",

    "## Question:\n",
    "\n",
    "How many distinct 7-digit numbers can you dial on a standard phone (layout: 123\\\\456\\\\789\\\\`*`0#) if you must start at the \"0\" and move only as a knight does in chess (an \"L\")? (Numbers mustn't include `*` or #.\n",
    "\n",
    "### My Solution:\n",
    "I am interpretting this as a graph structure with nodes and edges. The nodes are the numbers 0 to 9 and the edges between the linked nodes are defined by the \"L\" shaped move on a standard phone layout. This means that 0 is linked to 4 by and edge, and also to 6. This gives the following nodes and edges in the format (node: linked node, linked node,...) Listing all of the nodes and edges:\n",

    "(0: 4,6); (1: 6,8); (2: 7,9); (3: 4,8); (4: 0,3,9); (5: ~); (6: 0,1,7); (7: 2,6); (8: 1,3); (9: 2,4)\n",
    " \n",
    "Notice that 5 has no connecting edges or linked nodes. By the structure of the letters and the \"L\" shape, 5 cannot possibly be chosen. We can represent all of these nodes and edges in a 10x10 adjacency matrix, A, where the (i,j) entry is a \"1\" if there exists an edge between nodes i and j, and a \"0\" if no such edge is present."
