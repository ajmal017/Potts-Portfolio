# Potts-Portfolio
A Growing Collection of my work.

This collection is always growing and improving! Keep checking in for more work!

### Machine Learning
 - Currently taking CS5780 Machine Learning for Inteligent Systems at Cornell University
 - To see some of my work in machine learning, visit my [klml_supervised](https://github.com/kfpotts1/klml_supervised) repository.
 - Currently working in **Python**, looking into **Julia**
 
### Data Science
 - Current Member of the **Cornell Data Science** Project Team
  - Working in **R**
 - Time series analysis of financial data - See my ongoing `Market_Normality` project in the `data_science` folder.
  - Relies heavily on **Pandas**, **Numpy**, **Scipy**, **StatsModels**, and **Matplotlib**
 - Currently working on a project exploring Empirical Distributions of Touring Times of Non-Complete Graphs
  - Working in **Cython**
  - To be uploaded soon
  
### Mathematics
 - Empirical Distributions of Touring Times of Non-Complete Graphs, as described above
   - I have started to collect some of this work in Jupyter notebooks in my [graph_tour_sim](https://github.com/kfpotts1/graph_tour_sim) repository.
   - I have implemented the critical aspects of the project in **Cython** to speed up the simulations.
 - Study of the Thue-Morse Sequence
 - Study and implementation of Adaptive Quadrature
  - **Python**, see `numerical_analysis`
  
### Finance and Trading
 - Current member of the **Cornell University Algorithmic Trading Team**
 - `Market_Normality` research project as described above
